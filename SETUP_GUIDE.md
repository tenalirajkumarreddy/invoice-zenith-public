# Invoice Zenith - Public Access Setup

## 🎯 Changes Made for Public Access

This project has been modified to work **without authentication** and **without Supabase** for public demonstration purposes.

### ✅ What's Changed:

1. **Authentication Removed**: No login required - direct access to all features
2. **Mock Database**: Uses local JSON file instead of Supabase
3. **Sample Data**: Pre-loaded with demo customers, products, and invoices
4. **Public Routes**: All admin and agent features accessible publicly

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### Option 1: Frontend Only (Mock Data)
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

#### Option 2: Full Stack (Backend + Frontend)
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Start backend server
npm start
# Backend runs on http://localhost:3001

# In new terminal, start frontend
cd ..
npm install
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:8080 with API proxy
```
